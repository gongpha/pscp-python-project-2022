# Game Cheats
While you are playing a game, you can activate cheats. The cheats can do almost from standard to surreal actions.

They're created for debugging purposes. They also can kill a game if you're using them wrongly

## Activating
Hold the `F1` key until you heard a boom effect and the red text with 3 exclamation signs (!!!) popups at the bottom-left of the screen.

## Shortcut list
- `F2` - Freeze a clock from ticking
- `F3` - Force complete a pending order
- `F4` - Repeat an order without counting
- `F6` - Toggle NOCLIP mode
- `F7` - Force end a day
- `Shift + F7` - Force end a day with overwhelmed statistic numbers

## Deactivating
Once you activate the cheats, you cannot deactivate the cheats. You might have to go back to the main menu to reset the activated cheats.
