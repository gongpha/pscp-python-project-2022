Your owner is a lazy man
He said he have a work for you
He build the robot for you to control
You are Python in a Robot, a Shopkeeper Robot
The problem is that
Since you are a python
You don't know the language that your customers are speaking
But with the help of your translater, you can understand some bit of it 
However, It won't be enough 
You need to learn and memorize 
And you will be the perfect shopkeeper"
